### Cycle 1 Files
1. **nims.csv**: Cycle 1 NIMs measurements.
2. **metabolomics.csv**: Cycle 1 Comprehensive Metabolomics Measurements
3. **design.csv** Cycle 1 Strain Design Metadata (RBS strength for each gene, ect.)


### Cycle 2 Files (All pulled from EDD studies)
1. **Cycle2Batch3.csv**: EDD study export containing proteomics and production data for cycle 2 batch 3.
2. **Cycle2Batch4.csv**: EDD study export containing proteomics and production data for cycle 2 batch 4.
3. **Cycle2Batch5.csv**: EDD study export containing proteomics and production data for cycle 2 batch 5.
